# QR-code-generation-solution-Angular-Node
Here is the sample problem:

The user wants to generate QR Codes for application assets (identified via an ID). The user wants to be able to scan the QR Code with his phone and open the application asset in the browser.
The QR Code has not been generated yet. Your application is written in Angular and uses a NodeJS Server as Backend. A frontend page can load and display up to 10 already generated QR code images at the same time.

Restrictions:
- The QR Code must be generated on the backend
- It must be ensured that an asset with the give ID exists

Task:
- Solution for implementing generation and scanning of the QR Code.
- Provide a list of possible errors that the user could encounter.
